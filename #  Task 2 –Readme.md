#  Task 2 – Insert, Update, and Delete in SQL

##  Task Goal
To practice how to add, change, and remove data in a database using SQL.

##  Tools Used
- DB Fiddle or SQLiteStudio (to run SQL code)
- A text editor like Notepad (to write the .sql file)

##  Files Included
- `data.sql` – This file has all the SQL commands I wrote to:
  - Add data (INSERT)
  - Change data (UPDATE)
  - Remove data (DELETE)

 What I Did

 Insert
- I added 3 authors, 3 books, and 3 members to the library.
- I used `NULL` when some data was missing (like ISBN or email).
- I also added which member borrowed which book.

 Update
- I updated the missing email for one member.
- I updated the return date for a borrowed book.

 Delete
- I deleted a member who didn't borrow any books.
- I deleted a book that was never borrowed.
